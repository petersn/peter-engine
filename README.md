peter-engine
============

I keep copying this rendering code from directory to directory, and mutating it for each individual project.
This is ridiculous, so I decided to just factor it all out into peter-engine, my single unified game engine.

This code almost certainly will not be of use to you, I do not encourage anyone else to build on peter-engine, it's just public because that's my default for new repos.
